# airlineReservation

Some of the functionality is unimplemented but I mainly wanted the structure of the code to be checked. I think most things work, but once again, I'm
more concerned about the structure.
I created a flight database consisting of 1 flight in the main method. Next project I do will use SQL so I have a proper database.
